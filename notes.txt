Algorithmic Thinking
- Algorithmic is set of steps to finish a task
- Algorithm follow certain set of guidelines
    - must have a clear problem statement
    - must have clearly defined input and output
    - must contain specific set of instruction in a particular order
    - each step should be distinct and undividable into smaller steps
    - Algorithms must produce a result
    - Algorithm should complete
    - must have consistent results for the same set of input
- Algorithms must be correct
- They are 2 measures of Algorithm efficiency
    - Time complexity
        - amount of time taken to find a result
    - Space complexity
        - amount of space taken up by the Algorithm
Algorith efficiency is measured by looking at the worst case scenario



Linear Search
- is also known as sequential Search
- it works by sequentially going through the items in one by one
